# Hey there!

I am **Trishita Patra**, currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Data Science** at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/).  
I have a strong interest in **Machine Learning** and completed a **BS-MS dual degree in Mathematics** from [IISER Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/#gsc.tab=0).

I enjoy working on projects that blend theoretical foundations with practical applications.  
If youâ€™re interested in collaborating on an exciting project or idea, feel free to reach out.
